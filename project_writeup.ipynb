    "# Particle Filter Project\n",

    "In this project the objective is to implement a particle filter that can estimate the state of an object with respect to a global map using object relative sensor measurements (i.e. self driving car detecting a bicycle rider).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the problem it is important to understand the underlying theory behind using a particle filter. First of all a particle filter is non-parameteric bayesian filter (i.e. we are not assuming a gaussian distribution like in the kalman filter case). At high level the algorithm performs the following\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate particles in map that represent object.\n",
    "2. Predict where each model will be after timestep using motion model (bicycle model in this case).\n",
    "3. Receive measurement and compute likelyhood of object being at each particle using landmarks.\n",
    "4. Sample with replacement the particles with respect to each particles likelyhood.\n",
    "5. Repeat until only high likelyhood particles are present.\n",

    "The second step involves updating the state of each particle over timestep $\\Delta t$ using a motion model. We are going to model the object as having a constant turn rate and velocity magnitude. \n",
